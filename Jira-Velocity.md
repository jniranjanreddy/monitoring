How to estimate sprint velocity
In order to estimate what work can be completed in the future, you need to measure the work that has previously been done. To get a good average measurement of work that has been done, plan to review the previous three sprints.

In the following example, we will use story points to measure the amount of work completed in each sprint. A story point is a measurement used by Agile development teams to estimate how much effort and time it will take to complete a user story.

Step 1: Count how many user story points are completed in each sprint
At the end of a sprint, add up how many story points the team completed.

For example, assume that in sprint 1:

The team committed to completing five user stories.
Each user story had eight story points for a total of 40 story points.
The team completed three of the five user stories.
In sprint 2:

The team committed to seven user stories (including the two that were not completed in sprint 1).
Each user story had eight story points for a total of 56 story points.
The team completed four of the seven user stories.
In sprint 3:

The team committed to nine user stories.
Each user story had eight story points for a total of 72 story points.
The team completed five of the nine user stories.
Step 2: Calculate the average of completed story points
Simply add up the total of story points completed from each sprint, then divide by the number of sprints.

Sprint 1: 3 user stories x 8 story points = 24
Sprint 2: 4 user stories x 8 story points = 32
Sprint 3: 5 user stories x 8 story points = 40
Total = 96

So, your average sprint velocity is 96 ÷ 3 = 32.

You can now base the amount of work to be done in future sprints on the average of 32 story points. If you have 160 story points remaining to be completed in the project, you can assume that your team will need another five sprints to complete the project.

However, this is just an estimate and is accurate only if variables such as team size and project complexity and scope remain constant. Your teams will experience fluctuations from sprint to sprint. But the sprint velocity estimation is a good starting point to help you determine how much work your team can do.

If your team is new to Agile development, you won’t have any previous sprints to look at. As part of your sprint velocity estimation to-do list, you’ll have to complete a couple of sprints while tracking how many story points are completed in each. Then you will have some useful data that will help calculate an average.
